Adding the following workflow file, will make phpinsights run on pull request, where it will create a review with the errors.  
We also allow it here to run on pushes to the master branch. By allowing this, the badges for the master branch will be updated.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  static_analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Static analysis
    steps:
      # You must check out your repository, so we can analyse it
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: PHP Insights App
        uses: worksome/phpinsights-app@v0.1
        with:
          repo_token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          workingDir: '.'
          memory_limit: '1024M'
```

The action has the following parameters:
- `repo_token`: The GitHub API token, which is used to generate the review. Keeping it as `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` will make it use the token from the GitHub action.
- `workingDir`: This set's the directory which we will run the tool on. This is useful if you have a repository with multiple projects in it.
- `config_path`: (optional) Defines the path to where you php insights config file is, if it's not located in the default location.
- `memory_limit`: (optional) Set's the PHP limit, if more than the default memory is needed to run php insights on your code.
